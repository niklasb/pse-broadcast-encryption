Building
=================

It's as simple as

    mvn clean install
    pushd modules/server
    mvn package appassembler:assemble
    popd

Or using the shell/batch script `tools/build-all[.cmd]`, which 
does exactly this.

Running
=================

Running the server:

    bin/server

on Windows:

    bin\server.bat

Deploying the client app
=========================

    pushd modules/client
    mvn android:deploy
    popd
